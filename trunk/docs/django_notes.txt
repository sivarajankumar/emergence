Make sure the database is in sync
   $ python3.2 manage.py syncdb

To start the development server (other options described below)
   $ python3.2 manage.py runserver

Then go to
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

There are separate parameters for production (prod), testing (test) and development (dev).  Development is the default, but you can specify which you want like this:

   $ python3.2 manage.py runserver --settings=emergence.settings.prod

Workflow component (explorations in not reinventing the wheel)

Both of these are more for abstract process definitions, and don't seem to have anything
what would resemble command/commandset structure.

Celery: Distributed Task Queue
  This seems to be the way to actually do the execution and monitoring.  It automatically
  handles queuing, and distributed listener daemons on multiple servers.

  It requires a configurable message queuing system, such as RabbitMQ or Redis

  When I installed all this I got this the first time I ran syncdb:

  https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/1345
  
  I installed anyjson on my own, then ran into this error when doing syncdb:
  
  File "/opt/python-3.3.1/lib/python3.3/site-packages/django_celery-3.0.17-py3.3.egg/djcelery/picklefield.py", line 23, in <module>
    from django.utils.encoding import force_unicode
    ImportError: cannot import name force_unicode

  I had to manually fix this file, removing the import and single call to force_unicode, which isn'
  necessary in Django 1.6
