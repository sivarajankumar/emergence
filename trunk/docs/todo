- Add labels to toofiletype associations in tool definitions
- Allow definition of required input groups
- Preset, named parameter configurations.  Model them.
- The interface needs a consistent file preview ability that supports gzip peeking
- We need to have a central repository of flows which primarily serves to track flow usage.  Phone home capability should be built in (and configurable.)
